- [2017] EEG Brainwave Project:
    - <a href="https://github.com/EnyaKo/eeglab">eeglab</a>: An Android App and a EEGSensor Headband for Musical Capability Evaluation(An Ongoing Project)
    - The app shows the real-time brainwaves of the subject while recording them. It analyzes the data and shows a result of one's musical capability. I did much of the data visualization, including the real-time EEG signals and the result, and design the user interface of the app.  
- [2016] Data Mining Project:
    - <a href="https://github.com/Lee-W/vivid-bot">Vivid-bot</a>: A Chat Bot with Different Characteristics
    - My team was responsible for creating a connection between a Chinese words database and a chat bot via python djangle. I did much of the heavy lifting in terms of natural language processing, words filtering, and chat bot training, while assisting my teammates creating different characteristics for the chat bot. I was also the speaker of the presentation, invited by NCTU.
- [2016] Bioinformatics Project:
    - <a href="https://github.com/EnyaKo/Medical-App">Medical-App</a>: A Medical Android App and a GSensor Wristband to Keep Track of User's Elder Parents' Health Condition
    - The medical app analyzes the recieved data, sent by the wristband via bluetooth, and shows the result of one's activeness a day. I was responsible for building a mathematical model of the activeness calculation, by analysing data sets in R. I did the data visualization , while assisting my teammates building the database for medicine information. 
- [2015] Art and Microcomputer System Project:
    - <a href="https://github.com/EnyaKo/PiaNo-Jump">PiaNo-Jump</a>: An Installation Art for Christmas--A Giant Piano
    - A giant piano that plays notes, lights up pictures on a Christmas Tree, and plays christmas songs. More than a person to jump on and play the giant piano is encouraged, which is much more fun and enjoyable. I did much of all the programming, and was the designer of the giant piano, including the apperance design of the piano and the graphic design of the lighting pictures. 
- [2015] JAVA Game Design Project:
    - <a href="https://github.com/EnyaKo/Rockman">Rockman</a>: Rockman Computer Game
