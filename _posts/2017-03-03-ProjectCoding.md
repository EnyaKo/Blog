    - <a href="https://github.com/Lee-W/vivid-bot">Vivid-bot</a>: Chat Box with Different Characteristics
    - My team was responsible for creating a connection between the word database via python djangle. I volunteered to do much of the heavy lifting in terms of word processing and filtering to allow my teammates to concentrate on create different characteristics for a chat box. I was also the person that gave the final presentation in the end of the course.
