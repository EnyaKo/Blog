- Data Mining Project: 
    - <a href="https://github.com/Lee-W/vivid-bot">Vivid-bot</a>: A Chat Bot with Different Characteristics
    - My team was responsible for creating a connection between a Chinese words database and a chat bot via python djangle. I did much of the heavy lifting in terms of natural language processing, words filtering, and chat bot training, while assisting my teammates creating different characteristics for the chat bot. I was also the speaker of the presentation, invited by NCTU.
- Bioinformatics Project:
    - <a href="https://github.com/EnyaKo/Medical-App">Vivid-bot</a>: A Medical Android App and a GSensor Wristband to Keep Track of User's Elder Parents' Health Condition
    - The medical app analyzes the recieved data, sent by the wristband via bluetooth, and shows the result of one's activeness a day. I was responsible for building a mathematical model of the activeness calculation, by analysing data sets in R. In addition, I finished the data visualization of the medical app, while assisting my teammates building the database for medicine information.
