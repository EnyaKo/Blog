# Citi Immaginarie
- Based on our living experience in a city, we creatively design a small area of a city, making up its history, the land using and even the transformation of the urban planning. Then we were grouped in 16, and connected all our stories and city planning into a complete imaginary urban. It was like we made up a small piece of puzzles, and then put them all together into a beautiful and unique picture. 
- Here is the final story of our big city we made up: In 18th century, this was a city that had strong emphasis on goods transportation. There used to be a main port near a canal that imported and exported fish and seafood. At two sides of the canal were fish market and food processing industries, which then in 21th century have transformed into riverside parks and tourism factories. The train station on the other side of town was used for transporting factories' equipments and machine. At present, it has been used for a key mass transportation due to its fame of tourism and historic landscape. The city has been commercial residential mix-used since the residents make a living by running stores and restaurants for tourists.
